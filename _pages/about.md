Welcome to my homepage! I'm Vu Huyen Trang Pham (Huyen Trang). I am a research resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/) where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/) and Professor [Tan Nguyen](https://tanmnguyen89.github.io/). Before that, I graduated from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/) with a Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. During my time at the university, I also worked as a research student at [Data Science Lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/) where I had the opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of Professor [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/) and Dr. [Linh Ngo](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/).

## Research Interests 
My recent research focuses on advancing the theoretical foundations and practical applications of Mixture of Experts (MoE), Continual Learning, and Optimal Transport. In MoE, I explore novel gating mechanisms and statistical properties to improve efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale AI models. My work in Continual Learning addresses robustness in rehearsal-based methods, ensuring adaptive learning while preserving past knowledge. Additionally, I develop more efficient Optimal Transport techniques, such as Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance, to enhance computational performance while preserving topological structures. Through these efforts, I aim to bridge theoretical insights with real-world AI advancements.
